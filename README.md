## Movie Database App

This app was built to learn a sql database (postgres). 
So far, it has the capability to login a user and keep/show his stored like/dislike/favorite movies. 
The backend was built as a restful api. The frontend was done in React + Hooks + self-built Redux using useContext.   


### Improvements

- Learn to use useEffect more efficiently, at times it seemed to cause unnecessary re-renders
- Allow the user to create/update account
- Add testing
- Add the option to show more movies/shows
